# Pyrhon_HomeworkLists

## Project Overview
This repository contains Python solutions for various homework problems, along with their corresponding problem descriptions.

- `docs/` : Contains all homework problem statements in markdown format. Each file (e.g., HW30.md) describes the problem, input/output format, and sample test cases.
- `src/`  : Contains Python source code files for each homework problem. Each file (e.g., HW30.py) is the solution to the corresponding problem.

## How to Use This Project

1. **Browse Problems**
   - Go to the `docs/` directory to view homework descriptions and requirements.
   - Each markdown file is named as `HWxx.md` (where xx is the homework number).

2. **Find Solutions**
   - Go to the `src/` directory to find the Python solution for each problem.
   - Each Python file is named as `HWxx.py` and matches the corresponding problem in `docs/`.

3. **Run a Solution**
   - Open a terminal in the project root directory.
   - Run a solution by executing:
     ```sh
     python src/HWxx.py
     ```
   - Follow the input instructions in the corresponding `docs/HWxx.md` file.

4. **Test and Debug**
   - You can use the provided sample input/output in each markdown file to test the code.
   - If you want to modify or debug, edit the Python files in `src/`.

## Example Workflow

1. Read the problem statement in `docs/HW31.md`.
2. Check the solution in `src/HW31.py`.
3. Run the code:
   ```sh
   python src/HW31.py
   ```
4. Input sample data as described in the markdown file.
